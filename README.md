OCR System for Ashokan Brahmi

## Background

Inscriptions are, without doubt, the most important source of ancient Indian History. Unfortunately, although archeological sites attract lots of visitors and
tourists on a daily basis, few have any idea about these inscriptions, and much lesser people can identify, read or understand the inscriptions. 

To many who wish to, three major problems are generally faced: One, the inaccessibility and bad condition of some inscriptions. Two, the lack of knowledge of the script. Three, the lack of general resources for a common man to get a comprehensive understanding of the inscriptions.

## Solution Model

We have used a CNN based OCR Model for Ashokan Brahmi

### Dataset

3500 character images of 214 Ashokan Brahmi Characters from 25 Ashokan inscriptions, 
Further Augmented to get a dataset of 2,27,000 images

### Result

MobileNET model accuracy after 5 epochs:
Character Recognition - Method and Results
Validation Accuracy: 89.23%
Training Data Accuracy:89.86%
(With the Augmented dataset) With raw inscription images ~40%
